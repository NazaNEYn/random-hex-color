## How It Works
The program follows a simple logic:

1. A list of all possible hexadecimal characters (0-9 and a-f) is created.

2. The program then randomly selects six characters from this list.

3. These characters are joined together into a single string.

4. Finally, a hash symbol (#) is added to the beginning of the string to create the final hex color code.

## How to Run the Script
To run this script, you'll need Python installed on your computer.

1. **Save the code**: Copy and save the code into a file named main.py.

2. **Open your terminal**: Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.

3. **Run the script**: Type the following command and press Enter:
   ```python
   python main.py
   ```
Each time you run the script, it will print a different random hex code to the console.
